# Plan for Handling Components with Better Practices

## Issue Description
"Handle components with better practice"

## Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, I've identified several areas where component practices can be improved:

1. **Component Structure**: Some components are too large and have multiple responsibilities, making them harder to maintain and test.
2. **State Management**: State logic and UI rendering are tightly coupled in many components.
3. **API Calls**: API calls are directly embedded in event handlers within components.
4. **Error Handling**: Error handling is minimal, often just logging to console.
5. **Loading States**: Many components don't properly handle loading states during API calls.

## Approach
To improve component practices, I'll follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Break down large components into smaller, focused components.
2. **Custom Hooks**: Extract API calls and complex state logic into custom hooks.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate UI rendering from business logic.
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Implement user-friendly error handling.
5. **Loading States**: Add proper loading indicators during asynchronous operations.

## Implementation Plan
1. Analyze the current component structure to identify components that need improvement.
2. Start with the CartModal component:
   - Extract smaller components (CartItem, CartSummary, etc.)
   - Create custom hooks for cart operations
   - Implement loading states and better error handling
3. Apply similar improvements to other components if needed.
4. Test all changes to ensure functionality is preserved.
5. Document the improvements made.

## Expected Outcome
- More maintainable and testable components
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved user experience with proper loading and error states
- Consistent component patterns across the application
